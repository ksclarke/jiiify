### Introduction

Jiiify is an experimental Java-based IIIF (Version 2, Level 0) image server built with [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) (an event-driven, non-blocking, reactive tool-kit). Jiiify is still in active development and does not yet have a stable release.

As a "Level 0" IIIF image server, Jiiify does not generate images on-the-fly; instead it pre-generates the tiles and thumbnails necessary to use [Mirador](http://projectmirador.org/) and [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) (and perhaps other IIIF tiling clients). Archival images should be ingested into Jiiify so that tiles can be generated. Jiiify does not store the archival images, just the derivatives that are created. The archival images should continue to live in their repositories or on their separate archival file systems.

Note that in order to use Jiiify with Mirador, or other similar viewers, one must create IIIF Presentation API manifests and upload them into Jiiify using its Web-based administrative interface. There is not, currently, any mechanism for creating or editing IIIF presentation manifests within Jiiify itself. Currently, at my place of work, we use a script that builds a IIIF manifest from files on the file system and a CSV document with metadata.

### Installation

Jiiify is meant to be distributed as an executable jar file but, as there are no stable releases of Jiiify yet, if you want to experiment with it you'll need to build it yourself.

To do this, you will need [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed on your local machine. This is left as an exercise for the reader.

Once these pre-requisites are installed, you can create a development copy of Jiiify:

    git clone https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify.git
    cd jiiify
    mvn package

While images can be ingested and served without connecting Jiiify to [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/), parts of the administrative interface do require a Solr connection (for browsing images, searching for images, etc.) If you don't already have Solr running on your local machine (or even if you do), you can use Docker to easily bring up Solr at the place that Jiiify expects to find it. To do this, type:

    docker run --name jiiify_solr -d -p 8983:8983 -t solr
    docker exec -it --user=solr jiiify_solr bin/solr create_core -c jiiify

This will bring up Solr and create a core for Jiiify's use. Of course, after the first time this has been done, you only need to type the following to start the Solr container:

    docker start jiiify_solr

You can also choose to skip the above steps if you have Docker installed on your machine. There is a `startup.sh` script for developers to use that will download and startup a Solr Docker container for you. To run that script to start Solr and Jiiify, from within the project's main directory, type:

    target/startup.sh

The server should then be available at: [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443).

The out-of-the-box install uses a self-signed SSL certificate. You will be warned about this on connecting in the browser and you'll have to click through a warning, acknowledging that a self-signed certificate is being used. The self-signed certificate is regenerated if you run `mvn clean`. If you just use `mvn package` to rebuild the project the self-signed certificate will persist across builds.

Note that because of the way a Maven profile is activated, if you want to wipe your workspace and build a completely clean version, you'll need to use two steps:

    mvn clean
    mvn package

Those familiar with Maven may be tempted to combine those into `mvn clean package` but that will fail because of the way profiles for the build are activated. You can, of course, just use `mvn package` to rebuild the project. The clean is optional.

For more on using Jiiify (including how to ingest a sample image), visit the [project page](http://projects.freelibrary.info/jiiify).

### Running Jiiify in Production

Silly goose, you shouldn't be doing that yet.

But, there are [supervisord.conf](https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify/blob/master/src/main/resources/supervisord.conf) and [jiiifyNagios.sh](https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify/blob/master/src/main/scripts/jiiifyNagios.sh) files that you can use while running on a remote server, if you want.

### Connecting a JDWP agent or JMX monitor

You can build the project with support for connecting a JDWP agent by running with:

    mvn clean install -Ddev.tools="JDWP_AGENTLIB"

Or with support for a JMX monitor:

    mvn clean install -Ddev.tools="JMX_REMOTE"

Or with both:

    mvn clean install -Ddev.tools="JDWP_AGENTLIB JMX_REMOTE"

You can also supply the `dev.tools` variable in a default Maven profile. See [src/main/resources/settings.xml](https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify/blob/master/src/main/resources/settings.xml) for an example.

Once you run the `target/startup.sh` script, you'll be told which ports to use to connect your profiling or debugging client. If you want to enable these options on a remote machine instead, you'll need to edit the `target/startup.sh` file (after you've run the build) to allow that.

### Known Gotchas

If you use an IDE that builds the project automatically but doesn't refresh the project's resources at the same time you may run into issues with the startup script, self-signed certificates, etc. Consider turning off automatic building of this project in your IDE if this happens.
